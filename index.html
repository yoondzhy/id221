      <h2>World Flavors Blended on Kazakh Dastarkhan</h2>
      <p>This poster illustrates the richness of Kazakh cuisine in its diversity and each nation’s significance on our sacred dastarkhan. There are mainly dishes from various countries deeply woven into our daily eating habits, ones I especially love and miss, as well as some of the irreplaceable and significant dishes of authentic Kazakh cuisine, without which dastarkhan wouldn’t be complete. </p>
